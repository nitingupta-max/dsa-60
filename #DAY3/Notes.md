# Method
* A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task or operation. It is used to achieve the reusability of code. We write a method once and use it many times. We do not require to write code again and again. It also provides the easy modification and readability of code, just by adding or removing a chunk of code. The method is executed only when we call or invoke it.
* The most important method in Java is the main() method.
## Method Declaration
The method declaration provides information about method attributes, such as visibility, return-type, name, and arguments. It has six components that are known as method header, as we have shown in the following figure.

## Access Specifier
* Public, Private, Protected, Default.
## Static Method
A method that has static keyword is known as static method. In other words, a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class is known as a static method. We can also create a static method by using the keyword static before the method name.

The main advantage of a static method is that we can call it without creating an object. It can access static data members and also change the value of it. It is used to create an instance method. It is invoked by using the class name. The best example of a static method is the main() method.
## Instance Method
The method of the class is known as an instance method. It is a non-static method defined in the class. Before calling or invoking the instance method, it is necessary to create an object of its class. Let's see an example of an instance method.
## Method Overloading
Two or more methods can have same name but differnet parameters such methods are called methods.
